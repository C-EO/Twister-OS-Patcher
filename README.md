# TwisterOS-Updater
An updater for TwisterOS that automatically downloads, unzips, and runs the latest patch for TwisterOS.
If you're on a version that is not the previous latest (e.g. you're on 1.5 and the latest is 1.7) you WILL break your install, so it's recommened to run the tool at least once a week, or everytime you boot the Pi.

# Install
`cd ~/Downloads && wget https://github.com/FlameKat53/TwisterOS-Updater/blob/master/install.sh && ./install.sh`
